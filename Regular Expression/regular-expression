\w{4,7} will match at minimum 4 word characters and at maximum 7 word characters
    Example: 
    roa{3}r will match the characters ro followed by 3 as, and then the character r, such as in the text roaaar
    roa{3,7}r will match the characters ro followed by at least 3 as and at most 7 as, followed by an r, matching the strings roaaar, roaaaaar and roaaaaaaar

Optional Quantifier: ?
 For example, the regex humou?r matches the characters humo, then either 0 occurrences or 1 occurrence of the letter u, and finally the letter r.
Notice the difference between ? and \?

The Kleene star *: 
    meo*w will match the characters me, followed by 0 or more os, followed by a w. Thus the regex will match mew, meow, meooow, and meoooooooooooow.

The Kleene plus +: 
    meo+w will match the characters me, followed by 1 or more os, followed by a w. Thus the regex will match meow, meooow, and meoooooooooooow, but not match mew

The anchors har ^ and dollar sign $: (^xxxxx x xx $)
    ^Monkeys: my mortal enemy$ will completely match the text Monkeys: my mortal enemy but not match Spider Monkeys: my mortal enemy in the wild or Squirrel Monkeys: my mortal enemy in the wild
